### Day 1: June 20, 2018 (StudyNote) 
#### Basic variable, Data Type

**Today's Progress:** Started from beginner python again. Variable, Data Types, Error Handling

**Thoughts:** I am kind of rusty on Python, found out specific pep8 rules that I was not following. Keep it up!

### Day 3: June 22, 2018 (StudyNote) 
#### Data Structure(More about list), Pythonic code : 'do not use loop with else'

**Today's Progress:** Finish the list study, and started very confuse debate.. 
- Are `break` and `continue` bad programming practices?
- Do not use loops with `else`

**Thoughts:** I was trying to understand best pythoic code related with loop. Indifferent with other language, 
python allow to use `else` not only pair with if condition, with control flow. But not recommended. 
It's challenge to fully understand why we should avoid, then why python allow this. Hope I can have 
better understanding next time with this concept.
