### Variable Naming Rules
1. Can contain both letters and digits, but must begin with either a letter or an underscore
2. remember that Case matters, you can use upper case, but by convention we do not!
3. they cannot be python keyword
#### snake_case VS camelCase
> Class name user camel, others use snake_case
- Class name : Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Variable names : follow the same convention as function names.

## Data Type

PEMDAS - "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"
parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction

Strings cannot be changed after they are created, they are 
> immutable

everything you create is object, all objects have abilities or methods, 
think method as a functions that belong to object.
> Everything in python is an object, so anything that gets created will be one of these objects.
Objects can have data attributes, or properties, and methods, or behaviors. 
> Methods are just functions owned by the object. 

With dotnotation, you can access object's method

String methods.. .upper()  .lower() .title() str()
