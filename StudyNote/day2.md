### Exception
- D2_check_please.py
- D2_suggestinator.py
- D2_purchase_ticket.py - wrap exception with loop

### While loop 
- D2_password_checker.py
* good for condition based looping 
* [D2_password_checkers](D2_check_please.py)

**sys** this module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that
interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available [Learn More](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sys.html#sys.exit) 
> sys.exit([arg]) 
> exit from Python. This is implemented by rasing the SystemExit exception, so clean up actions specified by finally
clauses of try statements are honored, and it is possible to intercept the exit attempt at an outer level.

### for loop
* traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The Python for
statement iterates over the members of sequence in order, executing the block each time. Contrast the for 
statement with the "while loop", used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code 
forever. [Learn More](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop)
